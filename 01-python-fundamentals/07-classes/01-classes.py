# Classes are a form of complex data that combines data and functions.
# ML Libraries frequently provide classes as one of the main features, 
# where each model is a class that has an internal state as well as some
# useful functions for fitting/training the model and using it to make
# predictions.


# Classes are used throughout the programming industry, not just by ML
# folks.

# Note, for a version of this class with proper "doc strings" and many more comments
# see the supplemental folder.

class SimpleLinearRegression:
    # Note, all methods should take "self" as the first parameter.
    # This has to do with how Python implements classes. The first
    # passed parameter is always a reference to the current instance
    # of this class and the name is always "self" by convention.

print(linear_model.slope, linear_model.y_intercept) # 2, 0

# Using our predict method...

# Micro-exercise: Create a second instance of the SimpleLinearModel class
# then create two new lists of x and y data and fit the model on that data.
# Then, print the slope and y_intercept of your model, and use it to make a
# prediction for some made up x point.
