# Python Functions

This lesson introduces the foundations of Object Oriented Programming, specifically the all important `class/object` paradigm and corresponding constructs in Python.

## Prerequisite Expectations

* Understanding of Python fundamentals (variables, datatypes, control flow, and functions)

## Learning Objectives

* Students can define "classes" and "objects" including:
    * Creating them using Python code.
    * Describing classes as "templates" for custom data types.
    * Describing objects as "instances" of a class.
* Students can describe the purpose of "instances attributes" and "instances methods" as well as create them in Python code.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Finally, let the students work on the exercise alone or in small teams.

## Technology Requirements

* Any version of Python 3
